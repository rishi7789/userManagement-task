Project guide- 

Approach- Started with the backend first, express + typescript project setup, created the folder structure with routes, controllers, and a simple middleware for error handling. Implemented all basic CRUD APIs for users and tested them using Postman. Then started with frontend by creating UI with basic styling. Created table, modal and added form validation to the input fields, integrated backend CRUD api's using axios.

Tech stack used-
Backend- Express + Typescript

Frontend- Vite react + Typescript + TailwindCss

Project run commands(both frontend & backend) :

git clone repo-link
cd repo-name
npm i
npm run dev
